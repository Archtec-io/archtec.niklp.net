## Welcome to Archtec
We are a small crazy team consisting of:
Nik (admin, programmer), Homer (moderator, technology enthusiast), Lonny (moderator, nature enthusiast), Juri (experienced admin, Luanti server owner).
We speak German and English, attach great importance to good manners, and have our hearts in the right place. 
At Archtec many doors are open to you - no matter if you are a technophile, passionate about building, want to go on a **journey of discovery**, if you are young or "old" (you are always as old as you feel, lol) or just want to chop blocks as occupational therapy - at Archtec everyone gets his money's worth. Let your creativity run free. The lag is always kept low. From cute animals to big machines, Archtec leaves nothing to be desired. We are very relaxed and friendly. Just come by and see for yourself. We look forward to seeing you!
